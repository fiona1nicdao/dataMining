DataSaurus Dozen - 13 plots that use the same data but look very different 

Variance - how far is each data point away from the mean 
    data is wide spread  = high variance 
    standard deviation = sqaure root - regular unit 
    variance is a squared units / does not matter left or right 
    good to check SD 

range - what is the different between max and min 
    ex: 

Quartiles - sort the data and are partition of the data 
    divide the data in percential 
    50th percential: 50% of the data to the left and right 
    ex: donuts example 
    dec-cil - chunck the data into 10% 

Inter-Quartile range - better description tham the range
    used to figure out the outliers 

5 numbers sum : descripion of the dataset 

BOx plot slide :
    categorical variables on the x axis 
    numeric vairable are on the y axis 
    ex: graph for penguins 
    long box have high variance
    Whiskers : can't expand beyond a data point 
        can be the min value / can be max value 
        also can be the 1.5 X IQR min and max 
        ex: IQR = 10 , min =9, lower whisker 1.5XIQR = 15 BUT the lower whisker is 9 because can't go beyond the min data point 
    best to just be specific, when making plots 
Notched box plits 
    notches are the range of around the mean 
    confidence internal 90% / 95%
    use the median 
Box plots with the data points / best practice 
    to prevent the box plot to be misleading 
Histograms 
    represents the true shape of the data 
    x - axis is always numeric 
    measuring - 
    dis-cro-tiz (20 bins) - KNOW how many bins are are using 
    bin calculation : 
        smaller bins 10 large range of each bin = oversmoothing - not good 
        larger bins (40) = far more sensitive to noise 
    historgrams are used to generalize  the data 
    choice for number of bins are important 
    need to explain why used the number of bins 
    skeweds data (skewed distribution) - want logithmic bining so change the width of the bin 
    historgrams - assume conitnuous distribution
    eequal frequency binnning each bin width as the same number of data points  
slide 44 - 47 
slide 50 
    pie charts are the worst 
slide 53 
    color choices are important 
slide 55 
    make sure you are using things are that are color blindness 
    don't use only color to differeniate things 
slide 59 
    use proper axis 
    don't cherry pick your data 
    don't hide the zero 
    use the a properate scales
