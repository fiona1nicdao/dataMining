recap from last class 
    -boxplots 
    -notched box plots : the notches is 95% about the medium is within this range
        slide 11: different notched box plots / 95% intervals are how confident that this sample mean is to the population medium  
    - best practice : plot the actual dataset (don't want to overwell the readers)
    - don't have your plots to be 
    - box plots are uni-modol distribution 
    -scatter plots: useful 
        logarithm scales are good for some datasets 
        distribution of bi-variate data to see clusters of points, outliers 
        each pair of values treated a pair of coordinates and plotted as points in the plane 
    - scatter plots allows use to see relations: correlated data 
        positive correlated 
        negatively correlated
        uncorrelated 
        DO not want to cherry pick your data!!
