recap 
Data Reduction 
    - doing a sample should translate to the whole data : numerosite 
    -changing the format, reducing the footprint / loss-less compression (database programming) : datacompression 
        -lossy - loss some data and can't get it back 
        -lossy compression is more efficent and faster 
Dimensionality Reduction
    -lossy: don't want to overdo it and throw away too much data 
PCA - figure out a better axis 
    - the max amount of change will be for that vector 
PCA 
    - first change axis to have the zero means 
    - find the line of best fit, passing through the origin : rotate the line 
Assigning Loadings to Genes 
    - max variance / minimize the distance with each point on the line 
    - red line eigenvector 
More dimensions 
    - review 
    - will typically use the first principle component
    - principle components = number of dimensions 
    - will want to keep 2 princple components 
tSNE to the rescue 
     - make a distance matrix
     -clustered data with similar values 
     -REVIEW 
slide 28 : tSNE practical example
    - this is just separating the data into different clusters 
    -not reducing dimensions 
    -tSNE and PCA can be used together 
    - tSNE eigen values don't change
slide 31 
    - do PCA first then tSNE
    -UMAP ? 

review
- variance is the spread of the data from the mean 
- variance is defined with one attribute / variable 
- variance is high when there are outliers 
-covariance is for a pair of attributes
