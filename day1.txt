data brokers , data stored in servers , google ads, data mining , tiktok , instagram 
how did we get here ? - data mining 
    started with databases to store 
    statistics 
    AI, ML, Pattern Regnition 
    ex: K - means machine learning 
How do we 
    understand data, finding accosication rules, 
Data Mining Tasks: Associations & Correlations 
    ex: Jewels buy tea, coffee, will also buy milk 
Data Miniing Tasks: Clustering 
    finding patterns
    Gene co-expression
    market segmentation 
    finding patterns in data without a composs 
Data Mining Tasks: Prediction
    bot or not (botometer)
    classifying age of galaxies 
    making predictions on what is spam and not spam 
    data visualization - finding the patterns and able to visualize the data patterns 

Reflection: 
    I am super excited to start this course on Data Mining. I was surprised to learn how connected machine learning was to data mining. I remembered learning about K-means in the machine learning course.  I am excited to learn about the data mining task, such as associations and correlations and being able to find patterns. Also I am excited to learn about data visualization, because it is important to understand how to how your findings in a way non-computer science people will understand. 
    
    I would like it, if possible, to add what chapters in the book we should read before class, that would make it easier to plan out how much to read everyday.
