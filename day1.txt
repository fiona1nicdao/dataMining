how did we get here ? - data mining 
    started with databases to store 
    statistics 
    AI, ML, Pattern Regnition 
    ex: K - means machine learning 
How do we 
    understand data, finding accosication rules, 
Data Mining Tasks: Associations & Correlations 
    ex: Jewels buy tea, coffee, will also buy milk 
Data Miniing Tasks: Clustering 
    finding patterns
    Gene co-expression
    market segmentation 
    finding patterns in data without a composs 
Data Mining Tasks: Prediction
    bot or not (botometer)
    classifying age of galaxies 
    making predictions on what is spam and not spam 
    data visualization - finding the patterns and able to visualize the data patterns

big data analysis

chatGPT - moved to Azure cloud / bandwith / best is 100Gbps --> 10 Gbps document(load balancer) -->  other instances 
GPT4 - gpu /4  billions of parameters - every parameter is float 64 or 8 bytes / every instance needs a large gpu / programs software these run on 3rd party 
containers = allows to run on every machine that 
azure able to run if able to contianer-ize the project 
containers will use Docker 

What do you need to make a search web site 
    search algorithm 
    web crawler - to index the websites
